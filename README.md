# redgreenflaggame
This is flag collecting game that I did using javascript and html for my school project.
The scenario of this game is people have green and red flags behaviour.Our girl(player) is collecting as much green flags she can so she can have a great boyfriend.Our player's game is over when she touched a red flag.Of course It's not what happens in real life but It's more dramatic version of dating scenaris in life.

The game does not actual winner theme.You can simply collect many green flags you can in the given time.The player is represented by an image and can be moved using the arrow keys. If the player collects a green flag, their score increases, and a new green flag is randomly generated. If the player hits a red flag, the game is over.The game loop is handled by the update() function, which clears the canvas, draws the player and flags, checks for collisions between the player and flags, updates the score and time left, and handles the arrow key input.
